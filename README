XVM - An Extended Virtual Machine
=================================

-----------
Description

XVM Is a hobby project by me that is a virtual machine that lets you run simple ISO files.

Current issues:

- Text from VGA Not loading
- Not much opcode support (yet there are a lot but in a real world scenario its way more)
- Simple architecture, x86-64/32 limited.
